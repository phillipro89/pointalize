# Pointalize

**Compare credit cards, unlock rewards, and explore travel hacks, stories, and lifestyle perks to make every dollar and mile go further.**

Pointalize is an independent, data-driven platform focused on credit card optimization, travel rewards, and smart financial tools.
Behind the main website, several in-house WordPress plugins and SEO automation utilities are developed to support content accuracy, structured data, and performance.

## Purpose

The Pointalize ecosystem combines editorial content, analytics tools, and technical SEO components to deliver high-quality, trustworthy insights into:

- Credit card points and miles strategies  
- Reward program comparisons and value calculators  
- Travel hacks and real-world redemption guides  
- Technical SEO and automation infrastructure  

All plugins and backend components are built to improve transparency, automation, and user experience — both for readers and for the platform itself.

## Development Philosophy

Pointalize plugins follow a few strict principles:

- Clean PHP — no unnecessary dependencies or frameworks  
- Technical SEO-first — structured data, schema validation, and performance optimization  
- WordPress native — built to integrate seamlessly with custom post types, taxonomies, and page templates  
- Open and extensible — all plugins are designed to be modular and adaptable  

These plugins are gradually being published under the Pointalize namespace to support open-source collaboration.
